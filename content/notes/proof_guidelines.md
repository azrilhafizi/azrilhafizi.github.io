1. Begin sentences with word, not math symbol.
    - $A$ is a subset of $B$. ❌
    - The set $A$ is a subset of $B$. ✔️ 

    - $x^2 - x + 2 = 0$ has two solutions. ❌
    - The equations $x^2 - x + 2 = 0$ has two solutions. ✔️

2. End each sentence with a period, even when it ends with math symbol or expression.
    - Euler proved that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{s}}=\prod_{p\in P}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{p^{s}}}$ ❌
    - Euler proved that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{s}}=\prod_{p\in P}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{p^{s}}}$. ✔️

3. Separate math symbols and expressions with words.
    - Because $x^2 - 1 = 0$, $x = 1$ or $x = -1$. ❌
    - Because $x^2 - 1 = 0$, it follows that $x = 1$ or $x = -1$. ✔️

4. Avoid misuse of symbols
    - The empty set is a $\subset$ of every set. ❌
    - The empty set is a subset of every set. ✔️

    - Since $a$ is odd and $x$ odd $\implies x^2$ odd, $a^2$ is odd. ❌
    - Since $a$ is odd and and any odd number squared is odd, $a^2$ is odd. ✔️

5. Avoid using unnecessary symbols.
    - No set $X$ has negative cardinality. ❌
    - No set has negative cardinality. ✔️

6. Explain each new symbol.
    - Since $a|b$, it follows that $b = ac$. ❌
    - Since $a|b$, it follows that $b = ac$ for some integer $c$. ✔️

7. Watch out for "it".
    - Since $X \subset Y$, and $0 \lt |X|$, we see that it is not empty. ❌
    - Since $X \subset Y$, and $0 \lt |X|$, we see that $Y$ is not empty. ✔️
